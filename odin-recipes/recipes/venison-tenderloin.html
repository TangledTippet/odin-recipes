    <h2>Delicious tenderloind recipie for the hilodays</h2>
    <p>When you are blessed with a deer tenderloin, you will want to cook it simply — it is the filet mignon of venison. 
       Here’s how to cook a venison tenderloin perfectly, finished with a simple pan sauce you can use with all sorts of meats.</p>
       <p>I need to start with the obvious: Venison tenderloin is not venison loin. Loins, a/k/a backstraps, are the deer (or moose, elk, pronghorn, etc.) 
        equivalent of the ribeye in beef. They are great, but are not quite as tender, thus the name “tender” loin.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>12 ounces venison tenderloin</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespons safflower oil</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Pan sause</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon safflower oil</li>
            <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup red wine</li>
            <li>1 cup venison or beef stock</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon butter, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Salt the meat well and set aside while you mince the shallot for the pan sauce, or make whatever side dishes you have planned.</li>
            <li>When you are ready to cook the tenderloins, heat the safflower oil in a pan that will hold the meat — remember they contract when they hit the heat — over high heat. 
                Turn your stove fan on and pat the meat dry with paper towels.</li>
            <li>Set the tenderloins down in the pan. They will contract immediately. Let them sear hard for 2 minutes, then turn to another side of the meat. 
                Do this once or twice more, depending on how done you like your tenderloin. It's OK to sear a side more than once if you need to. 
                Move the meat to a cutting board and grind black pepper over it.</li>
            <li>Add the extra safflower oil to the pan, then the shallots, and sauté until the shallots brown a little. 
                Use a wooden spoon to move the shallots over any browned bits in the pan to lift them off the metal.</li>
            <li>Add the red wine and let this boil for a few seconds, then add the stock. Sprinkle a little salt over boiling sauce. 
                Let this boil down for a few minutes, until the whole surface of the pan is covered in bubbles, 
                and the wooden spoon leaves a trail when dragged through the center of the pan. Turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Swirl in 1 tablespoon of the butter until it incorporates, then the other. 
                Slice the venison into medallions and pour over the sauce. Serve at once.</li>
        </ol>
