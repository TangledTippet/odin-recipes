    <h2>Hot to cook Duck Breast</h2>
    <p>If there is a bedrock duck breasts recipe, it is this one. 
        One of the most common requests I get from readers is for step-by-step instructions on how to cook a duck breast properly. 
        And this same technique works for goose breasts, as well as any other dark meat bird breasts, 
        like pigeons, sharp-tailed grouse and the like.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 duck breasts (breasts from two ducks)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon duck fat or olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Take the duck breasts out of the fridge. If you are using a domestic duck or a very fat wild duck, 
                score the skin (but not the meat) in a cross-hatch pattern, making the cross-hatches about 1/2 inch across; 
                this helps the fat render and will give you a crispier skin.</p><p>Salt it well on both sides, 
                then let it sit on a cutting board for at least 15 minutes and up to 45 minutes for a goose breast.</p></li>
            <li>Pat the duck breasts dry with paper towels. If you are cooking a domestic duck or a very fat wild duck,
                 put 1 teaspoon of duck fat or cooking oil in a large pan; Lay the breasts skin side down and use them to smear the fat all over the surface of the pan. 
                 Turn the heat to medium-high. Yes, you read that right: Don't preheat the pan. 
                 You want as much fat to render out as possible, so start with a cool pan.</li>
        </ol>
