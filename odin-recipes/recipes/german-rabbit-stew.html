    <h2>Stew for the holidays</h2>
        <p>This is an unusual German rabbit stew with the memorable name of eingemachtes kaninchen,
        according to Mimi Sheraton in her excellent book The German Cookbook: A Complete Guide to Mastering Authentic German Cooking.
        Itâ€™s a light, bright counterpoint to the more famous hasenpfeffer, which is made with hare.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>2 cottontail rabbits, or 1 domestic rabbit, cut into serving pieces</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Salt the rabbit pieces well and set aside for 10 minutes or so. Set a Dutch oven or other heavy, 
                    lidded pot over medium-high heat. Add a tablespoon of butter. Pat the rabbit pieces dry and brown well on all sides. 
                    You may need to do this in batches, so don't crowd the pot and don't rush things. Remove the rabbit pieces once they're browned. 
                    This may take 15 minutes or so.</li>
                <li>Add the remaining tablespoon of butter, then the sliced onion and cook until the edges just begin to brown, about 6 minutes. 
                    Sprinkle with flour and stir well. Cook, stirring often, until the flour turns golden, about 5 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
